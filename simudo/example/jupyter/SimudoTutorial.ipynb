Since DOLFIN/FEniCS do not know about Pint Quantities, Simudo has a number of utilities to load and unload the units to/from objects.

For the geometric mesh, the initial spacing is `start` and the growth factor is `factor`, so it also creates a constant mesh when used with `factor=1`.\n"

In this pn-diode, an optical absorption process would have `src_band = VB` and `dst_band = CB`.
