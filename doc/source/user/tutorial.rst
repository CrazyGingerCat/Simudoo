pn-diode example
################

Now that you've installed Simudo, you can perform the most basic of
simulations. Namely, getting a J(V) curve for a diode (pn-junction).

Download the pn-diode_ example, then run::

  python3 pn_diode.py run

.. _pn-diode: https://github.com/simudo/simudo/raw/master/simudo/example/pn_diode/pn_diode.py

This will run the simulation, a voltage sweep from 0V to 1V. It should
take 2-4 minutes, and it will produce a series of files containing
spatial data (e.g.,
``output V_stepper_parameter=0.00000.csv.0``), and a CSV file
containing summary data (``output V_stepper_parameter.csv``).

You can produce a plot of total current as a function of applied voltage:

using the following code:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../simudo/example/pn_diode/pn_diode_plot.py
   :language: python


fourlayer example
#################

Now letâ€™s try an example that contains an intermediate band, using the fourlayer_ helper. :file:`fourlayer.py` contains useful helper methods to set up and run 
Simudo simulations for 1D devices with four layers: front-surface field (FSF), 
p-type semiconductor, IB region, n-type semiconductor. The purpose of this example 
is to provide a model that you can modify for your own purposes.

.. _fourlayer: https://github.com/simudo/simudo/raw/master/simudo/example/fourlayer/fourlayer.py


The most useful method in :file:`fourlayer.py` is :command:`run`, which takes in a yaml file containing
a dict of parameters and runs Simudo as requested in that file. You can set up a 
submitfile using :command:`fourlayer.multiplex_setup`. 

Look at fourlayer_example_ for an example of using :file:`fourlayer`. It is not chosen to be a particularly good IBSC! 
You can move fourlayer_example_ to a location of your choosing and then run::

  python3 -u fourlayer_example.py | tee -a out.txt

.. _fourlayer_example: https://github.com/simudo/simudo/raw/master/simudo/example/fourlayer/fourlayer_example.py

You will see a lot of screen output as the desired problem is set up and first the optical 
intensity and then the voltage ramp to the desired values. It will run for 20-25 minutes, 
and a number of output files will be produced in 
:file:`test/`, including yaml files with integrated quantities at each desired voltage and csv files 
with spatially varying quantities on a line cut through the centre of the device. 
The sample simulation should give an efficiency of 34.1%. 
Note that most of the output that you saw in the pn-diode example is not sent to the screen. You can see more details in the info.log and debug.log files.

The methods in sweep_extraction_ are helpful for gathering the output from 
:file:`fourlayer_example` and making a variety of plots. The example comes configured to run 
a single Simudo calculation and output both a JV curve and a band diagram at short circuit, which should appear as png files. 

.. _sweep_extraction: https://github.com/simudo/simudo/raw/master/simudo/example/fourlayer/sweep_extraction.py

There are several helpful features in :file:`fourlayer_example`, which you can find
in that file. For example, you can modify it to find the value of `IB_thickness` that optimizes device efficiency by setting :code:`params['optimize_key'] = 'IB_thickness'`. Please `contact us <mailto:jkrich@uottawa.ca>`_ if you have any questions.

Jupyter notebook
################

There is a Jupyter notebook form of the pn-diode_ example to walk through the pieces of setting up a Simudo problem more slowly. 
You can find it in :file:`simudo/example/jupyter/SimudoTutorial.ipynb`.
